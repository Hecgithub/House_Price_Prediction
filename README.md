# House_Price_Prediction :houses::house_with_garden::dollar:
 
## Overview of the Project :scroll:

The housing market is subject to the same economic laws of supply and demand as every other industry. When there are more buyers than sellers, the supply of houses goes down, and demand increases, making houses harder to buy and more expensive. In addition to the supply and demand of a market, the characteristics of units being sold also affect the selling prices of homes. A property's size, location, appearance, and other features can affect its demand and price. The state of the economy, crime rates and changes in the size of the population also influences the housing market. Over time, the price of houses fluctuates. If you want to buy a home, understanding what makes prices go up helps you know when and where you'll get the best price for a home. We aim to make our evaluations based on every basic parameter that is considered while determining the price of a housing unit. 

Using a machine learning model, we will make predictions to try to achieve a high accuracy score and predict the house prices.

## Communication Protocols :phone:

For effective peer-to-peer communication, slack was used for team channel creation/messaging and zoom for team meetings.

## Database

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-blue?style=for-the-badge)

PostgreSQL is used for data storage, processing, retrieval and analysis to support finding insights from our Houston Houses Merged Data.

A mockup of the code to write the house data to the postgres data base can be found here: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/04_Database/04_Database_houseData.ipynb)**.

Similarly, the crime statistics table is saved to the data base using the following code: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/04_Database/04b_Save_to_Database_crimeData.ipynb)**.

## Resources/Data Sources ðŸ’¼

Data for analysis has been extracted from [RapidAPI.com](https://rapidapi.com/apimaker/api/zillow-com1)

#### Zillow.com API Documentation (apimaker) | RapidAPI

Unofficial API. US and CA real-time real estate data. Search by coordinates and MLS. This site allows us to explore and extract data from two APIs endpoints:
* Property details
* Property Extended Search

Additionally, crime statistics per zip code for the city of Houston was obtained from the Houston police department website. 

The code used to gather the house data is here: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/01_Gathering/01a_Get_House_Data.ipynb)**.

The code used to gather the crime statistics data is here: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/01_Gathering/01b_Get_Crime_Data.ipynb)**.

The data was merged using this code: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/02_Merging/02_Merge_Data.ipynb)**

## Questions We Would Like to Answer :memo:

* Can we predict the price of a house?
* What are the features that can be used to predict the price of a house?
* What are the main features that determine the price of a house?
* What other external factors affect the price of a house?

## Data Preprocessing ðŸ”¬

Pandas library is used to perform the data manipulation in Python. Pandas library is extremely powerful and helped us to simplify data cleaning tasks like data inspection, data fill, loading and saving data, mergers and join, duplicate, import data and much more.

A folder containing three files with code to pre-process the data can be found here: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/03_Preprocessing/)**

## Implementing machine learning model(s) ðŸ¤–

For this analysis, we used three different machine learning models, which are Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBRegressor. In comparing the three models, the XGB Regressor model was far more accurate. The model had a 80% accuracy in predicting the house prices in the Houston, Texas, area. After plotting to find the features importance, we found the top four are constructed area, lot area sqft, zip code, and year built.

Machine learning is an iterative process. This first round of data exploration and model evaluation was an excellent start to gain insights quickly and get a reasonably good model prototype. This dataset has much structure, and further work is required to build a high-performing prediction model.

The machine learning model code mockup can be found here: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/05_ML_Model/ML_House_Prediction_Prices_Updated.ipynb)**.

A machine learning mockup reading the input data from the Postgres dabatase can be found here: **[link](./03_Code_and_Data/05_ML_Model/05_ML_Model_read_from_JoinedDB.ipynb)**.

## Results of Analysis :clipboard:

The supervised machine learning algorithms are used to predict the final outcome since we are using data from previous outcomes.
The three regression models were trained with the data and the calculated accuracy score details of each model is as below:
* The Linear Regression Model had an accuracy score of 51%.
* The Random Forest Regression model had an accuracy score of 67%.
* The XGBRegressor(Extreme Gradient Boost) model had an accuracy score of 80%.

The XGBRegressor model was the best in predicting the house prices. The features that held more weightage in predicting the prices were plotted.

## Project Summary :books:

* ### The answers we were seeking for the questions:

 **Can we predict the price of a house?**

 Yes, After implementing three supervised machine learning algorithms, the XGBRegressor had a good accuracy score of 80% in predicting the house prices.

 **What are the features that can be used to predict the price of a house?**

 The internal housing features like bedrooms, bathrooms, constructed area, lot size and external features like locality, crime and presence of schools were used in predicting the house price.

 **What are the main features that determine the price of a house?**

 The important features in determining the final outcome was plotted. They are constructed area, lot area, year built, average school distance, zip code, crime     percentage, bedrooms, bathrooms and average school rating.

 **What other external factors affect the price of a house?**
 
 Apart from the basic internal housing units, the external factors like crime rates, locality and nearby schools influence the pricing of the house.

* The visualization of the dataset is done in Tableau. An Interactive map with filters has been designed to provide a good insight of the dataset(distribution of the houses).
* Using TabPy, the machine learning model was trained with user selected features and the predicted outcome was displayed in Tableau dashboard.
